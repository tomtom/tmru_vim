This plugin provides a simple most recently used files facility. Users 
can use patterns to filter the file list. Users can open multiple files 
at once.

:TRecentlyUsedFiles ... open one or more recently used file(s)
:TRecentlyUsedFilesEdit ... edit the mru list

If viminfo contains "!", the data is stored as global variable. Otherwise,
tlib#cache is used -- which saves the data in ${vimfiles}/cache/tmru/files
by default.

By default tmru matches the search pattern on the full filename. If 
you want to match on the basename, add the following to 
~/vimfiles/after/plugin/tmru.vim: >

    let g:tmru_world.filter_format = 'fnamemodify(%s, ":t")'

If you want to retain the last filter between calls of :TRecentlyUsedFiles, you 
could also add the following lines: >

    let g:tmru_world.cache_var = 'g:tmru_cache'
    let g:tmru_world.restore_from_cache = ['filter']
